### IRMMa Risk Calculator manual

This website is a tool to calculate risks according to an individualâ€™s characteristics. 

* Please first complete the Attribute Form which is the set of features used to calculate multistate/treatment risks. <br /> *Age* (*Demographics*), *ISS*, and Induction (Phase 1) (*Therapy*) are **mandatory fields**. <br /> If there is no selection on *IGH-Translocations* or *Genomics*, the default is NA. 
* When you have completed your selections, press the *Submit* button. Of note, the threshold for  minimum number of cases that IRMMa utilizes to make a prediction is 1.

**Once submitted, IRMMa calculates risks and the following is displayed:**

* **State Risk** - Multistate risks from start of P1 up until 5 years.
* **Treatment-Adjusted Risk** - Risk of POD and/or death at 5 years based on selected and alternative P1 treatment combinations and P2 treatments, MAINT/CONT.TREAT and HDM-ASCT.

**For interpretation of risks**, please refer to figure below, where the risks are of the query with respect to the knowledge bank scores.

## Example usage

**Acronyms/definitions**:

* **IRMMa** - Individualized Risk Model for Myeloma.
* **MAINT/CONT.TREAT (M.C.T.)** - Maintenance/continuous treatment (Defined as either maintenance therapy continuing after induction or a treatment lasting more than 12 months, Palumbo et al. JCO 2015).
* **CHEMO** - Any chemotherapy regiment received except high-dose melphalan. This includes cyclophosphamide, low-dose melphalan, or any platinum-based chemotherapy.
* **HDM-ASCT** - High-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
* **Induction, Phase 1 (P1)** - Induction treatment within 1 year.
* **Post-Induction, Phase 2 (P2)** - Addition of HDM-ASCT and/or MAINT/CONT.TREAT or neither upon completion of P1 (without POD).
* **POD** - Progression of Disease.
* **Probability of being alive** - Probability of *Alive in P1 + Alive after POD (P1) + Alive in P2 + Alive after POD (P2)*.
* **Probability of POD** - Probability of *Alive after POD (P1) + Alive after POD (P2) + Death after POD (P1) + Death after POD (P2)*. 
* **Risk of POD and/or deceased** - Probability of *Alive in P1 + Alive after POD (P1) + Death after POD (P1) + Death in P2 + Alive after POD (P2) + Death after POD (P2)*.
* In **Treatment-Adjusted Risk** plot, for each therapy $i$ where $i$ are all the combination therapies that is present in our knowledge bank, we provide the variance **var (%)** as the difference in risk between query ${q}$ selected therapy in P1, P2 and alternative therapy $i$. $var = {risk_i - risk_q \over risk_q}\times100$. Thus negative var indicates reduced risk of POD and/or death in comparison to query selected therapy, positive indicates worse risk of POD and/or death, 0 indicates risk of query $q$.
