### IRMMa Risk Calculator - User Guide

This website is a tool to calculate risks according to an individualâ€™s characteristics. The Attribute Form is the set of features used to calculate multistate/treatment risks. Age (Demographics), ISS, and Induction (Phase 1) (Therapeutics) are mandatory fields. Please select them in the section to the left by clicking one of the section drop-downs. If there is no selection on IGH-Translocations/Genomics, the default is NA. When you are done, press the Submit button.

Once submitted, IRMMa calculates risks and the following is displayed:
**State Risk** - Multistate risks from start of P1 up until 5 years.
**Treatment** - Adjusted Risk - Risk of POD or death at 5 years based on selected and alternative first-line treatment combinations and P2 treatments, C.T. and HDM-ASCT.

**Acronyms/definitions**:
**IRMMa** - Individualized Risk Model for Myeloma.
**MAINT/CONT.TREAT (M.C.T.)** - Maintenance/Continuous Therapy (Defined as either maintenance therapy continuing after induction or a treatment lasting more than 12 months Palumbo et al. JCO 2015).
**CHEMO** - Any chemotherapy regiment received except high-dose melphalan. This includes cyclophosphamide, low-dose melphalan, or any platinum-based chemotherapy.
**HDM-ASCT** - High-dose Melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
**Induction, Phase 1 (P1)** - Induction treatment within 1 year.
**Consolidation, Phase 2 (P2)** - Addition of HDM-ASCT and/or continuous treatment or neither upon completion of P1 (without POD).
**POD** - Progression of Disease.
